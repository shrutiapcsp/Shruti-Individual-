**5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns**:
Licensing
- Open Source (General Public Licencing): any derivative work free, code shared -> download Linux off the internet for "free"
- Black Duck Software composition analysis helps teams manage risks from using open source and third party code
- Patent: derivative work requires royalty payment, using idea must pay royalty
- Free + patent -> anything derrived is free (violates the patent)
License Communities/Types
- Address: waiving copyright, allowing derrivative works, sharing of derivative code
- Creative Commons: waives copyright interest, world-wide domain
- Open Source MIT Licence: use code freely, make/distribute in closed source
- Open Source GPL License: anything except distributing closed source versions
Legal/Ethics
- Need to cite sources
- Use open source according to terms of license

**5.6: Safe Computing**
Personal Identifiable Information
- Things known by everyone: name, email, picture, high school, college, credit, etc
- Gray = more cautious: birthdate, place of birth, street address, phone number, drivers license number
- Secret = credentials for across, social security number, tax records
Safety
- Multi-factor authentication
- Malware sent in attachments in email
- Phishing to get virus on machine
Increasing Safety
- Multi-Factor authentication
- Biometrics: fingerprints, facial recognition
- Symmetric encryption: one key used to encrypt and decrypt electronic information
- Asymmetric cryptography: one public key, one private key to encrypt and decrypt message
- SSL uses asymmetric and symmetric encryption

## **GitHub Actions:**
**5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns**:
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

**5.6: Safe Computing**
1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. 
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure? 
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. 
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. 
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment. 
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

## Week 1 - Test Prep
### (5.3-5.4 Notes, Github Actions)

### **5.3 - 5.4 Notes:**

**5.3 Computer Bias**:
- Humans are error-prone and biased
- Computing bias can be intentional or purposeful
- Facebook/TikTok/Netflix has purposeful exclusion with their algorithms
- Computing innovations reflect human biases written into algorithms (enhancing or intentionally excluding, harmful/hateful, receiving feedback from wide variety of people)
- Explicit Data: Thumbs, Name, address 
- Implicit Data: When you watch, What you watched, Style of show frequently selected

**5.4 Crowdsourcing**: 
- Crowdsourcing: obtaining input/info from large number of people via Internet 
- Models for collaboration- connecting businesses, social causes 
- Distributed and “citizen science” to solve problems 
- Individuals (not scientists) who contribute relevant data
- Wikipedia uses crowdsourcing, can be innacurate
- Crypto/ exchanges of money validated by independent miners
- Flaws: checked, performed again
- COVID data has been essential for public events 
- Crowdsourcing through API's, GitHub code

## **GitHub Actions:**
**5.3 Computer Bias**:
1. Video Reflection
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? No I doubt this was intentional because a large company like HP with diverse employees likely did not seek to exclude particular races.
- How do you think this happened? The workers at companies influence the products they make. I predict that HP has mostly caucasian engineers working on this product, and therefore they neglected to address the implications of other skin colors on their technology.
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? This is incredibly harmful and shameful on the part of HP's technological team. In a diverse world, it is essential that people feel represented in the technology they use. This can be seen as a form of discrimination that can have serious implications if repeated in other forms of techology.
- Should it be corrected? Yes this should be corrected to represent all of HP's customers.
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? The first step is to ensure that HP is promoting an inclusive and diverse environment. Next, the engineers need to address the technology they used and see if one's skin color is impacting the recognition of faces or if this is a more nuanced issue. 

**5.4 Crowdsourcing**:
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? A google survey, sent through slack, could be used to obtain information from computer science princples about their opinions on improvements that can be made to the class.
2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing? Our final project, based on creating a test prep website for AP exams at Del Norte, could benefit from crowdsourcing. We can see what topics students desire to learn and what study methods work best for them through our google survey.

## Week 0 - Test Prep 
### (5.1-5.2 Notes, Github Actions)

### **5.1 - 5.2 Notes:**

**5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects**: Effects of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful

- Effects can be seen as both beneficial and harmful 
- Open-source software for computer and printer: adjust/edit as you see fit
- Advances in computing -> creativity in other fields (medicine, engineering, etc)
- Computing innovations can be used in ways creators not originally intended 
- Microtransactions: “free” games/apps, coins/gold, cosmetics
- People create computing innovations
- A signal effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
- Innovations can be sued if they have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture

**5.2 Digital Divide**: Specific issues contribute to the digital divide
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, demographics
- “Digital divide” = different access to computing devices and Internet
- Computers not common in rural areas, surveillance
- This raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally

## **GitHub Actions:**
**5.1 - Harmful/Beneficial Effects of Computing**
1. Social Media: benefits- allows for people to communicate on a global scale, harmful- cyberbullying Email: benefits- allow for people to send mail instantaneously virtually, harmful- phishing attempts or viruses Automated vehicles: benefits- no need for drivers, makes life easier, harmful- safety concerns if new circumstance comes. 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? Dopamine issues are real. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and therefore affects our brain chemistry and the firing of neurons. Our personal reward center can influence how we act in situations. My phone can sometimes affect my personal study and success in High School because social media apps and text messages can affect my concentration in classes.

**5.2 - Digital Divide**
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world? One can empower themselves by educating themselves about technology and knowing the harmful and beneficial impacts of the internet. It is necessary to understand how technology can be used to solve problems or make life easier, on the other hand, some websites can have viruses or compromise one's identity.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Someone who is empowered can share their knowledge about the digital world with others. At Del Norte, this could involve helping a friends who is unsure how to use a certain app or website and help them keep their information private.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Yes, while it may be annoying to see blocking of websites, having certain barriers are essential to ensure that users stay safe and only view content that will be beneficial for them. At Del Norte, certain webpages are flagged as inappropriate and are therefore restricted, this means that if students are on the WiFi, they can't view certain pages. Some YouTube videos also have barriers depending on the age and target viewer.

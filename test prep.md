### (5.1-5.2 Notes, Github Actions)

### **5.1 - 5.2 Notes:**

**5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects**: Effects of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful

- Effects can be seen as both beneficial and harmful 
- Open-source software for computer and printer: adjust/edit as you see fit
- Advances in computing -> creativity in other fields (medicine, engineering, etc)
- Computing innovations can be used in ways creators not originally intended 
- Microtransactions: “free” games/apps, coins/gold, cosmetics
- People create computing innovations
- A signal effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
- Innovations can be sued if they have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture

**5.2 Digital Divide**: Specific issues contribute to the digital divide
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, demographics
- “Digital divide” = different access to computing devices and Internet
- Computers not common in rural areas, surveillance
- This raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally


## **GitHub Actions:**
**5.1 - Harmful/Beneficial Effects of Computing**
1. Social Media: benefits- allows for people to communicate on a global scale, harmful- cyberbullying Email: benefits- allow for people to send mail instantaneously virtually, harmful- phishing attempts or viruses Automated vehicles: benefits- no need for drivers, makes life easier, harmful- safety concerns if new circumstance comes. 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? Dopamine issues are real. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and therefore affects our brain chemistry and the firing of neurons. Our personal reward center can influence how we act in situations. My phone can sometimes affect my personal study and success in High School because social media apps and text messages can affect my concentration in classes.

**5.2 - Digital Divide**
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world? One can empower themselves by educating themselves about technology and knowing the harmful and beneficial impacts of the internet. It is necessary to understand how technology can be used to solve problems or make life easier, on the other hand, some websites can have viruses or compromise one's identity.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Someone who is empowered can share their knowledge about the digital world with others. At Del Norte, this could involve helping a friends who is unsure how to use a certain app or website and help them keep their information private.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Yes, while it may be annoying to see blocking of websites, having certain barriers are essential to ensure that users stay safe and only view content that will be beneficial for them. At Del Norte, certain webpages are flagged as inappropriate and are therefore restricted, this means that if students are on the WiFi, they can't view certain pages. Some YouTube videos also have barriers depending on the age and target viewer.
